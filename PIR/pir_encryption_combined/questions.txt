Q14. What can an eavesdropper learn from encrypted traffic?

    They can still observe:

    Packet sizes (may hint at DB size)

    Timing/frequency (when communication occurs)

    But cannot know:

        The content of data

        Which record the client wanted

        Any meaningful pattern in the transferred bytes

Q15. How does combining PIR with encryption improve privacy vs using either alone?
    Technique	        Protects Against Server	          Protects Against Eavesdropper	    Limitation
    Encryption	        ❌ (Server knows query)	        ✅ (Hides content)	             Query pattern visible
    PIR	                ✅ (Server doesn’t know record)	❌ (Traffic observable)	         High bandwidth
    PIR + Encryption	✅	                        ✅	                                 Expensive, slower
