Q10. What privacy does trivial PIR provide? What can the server still learn?

    Privacy provided: The server cannot tell which specific record the client accessed since it always sends the entire database.

    Server can still learn: That a query occurred and when it occurred (timing, frequency), but not which record was requested.

Q11. What are the limitations of trivial PIR? When is it practical?

    Limitations:

        Very high bandwidth (must download entire DB).

        High latency for large datasets.

        Impractical for real-world databases with millions of entries.

    Practical when:

    Database is small.

    Privacy is more important than performance (e.g., research/demo).

Q12. If each record is 1KB and the database has 10,000 records, how much bandwidth per query?
   1 KB/record×10,000=10,000 KB=10 MB per query.

Q13. In Wireshark, how can you tell if someone is using PIR vs normal queries?

    Trivial PIR shows large uniform-sized data transfers for each query (entire DB each time).

    Normal queries show small selective packets corresponding to only one record.
